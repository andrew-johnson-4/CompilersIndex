# Contributing

Any and all contributions to CompilersIndex are dutifully appreciated. Contributions are assumed to grant permission to use under the terms of the attached MIT permissive license.

The file structure of this project follows this pattern:
- tag1/
- tag1/child_tag2/
- tag1/child_tag2/markdown_list.md

The one exception to this file structure is the *master_list/* folder which duplicates all information into the form of YAML files organized one per compiler.

Compilers may appear in multiple indices. Contributions across the project get merged/conflict-resolved during index construction. So whether a contribution edits an index or adds a YAML tag, the information will still propagate both ways.

To see open problems, see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/CompilersIndex/issues). For suggestions or questions, open a new issue.
