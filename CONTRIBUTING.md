# Contributing

Any and all contributions to CompilersIndex are dutifully appreciated. Contributions are assumed to grant permission to use under the terms of the attached [MIT permissive license](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/CompilersIndex/blob/main/LICENSE).

The file structure of this project follows this pattern:
- master_list/project_name.yaml
- index/tag/README.md

Compilers may appear in multiple indices. Contributions should edit the master-list so that information will then be passed down to the indices.
